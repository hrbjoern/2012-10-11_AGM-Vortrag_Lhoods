  \item Poissonian probability mass function:
\beq 
%\begin{equation}
P(x|\mu) = \frac{\mu^x}{x!}e^{-\mu}
\eeq
--- probability to observe $x$ events, when the expectation value is~$\mu$. \\

%\vspace{10mm}

 ~ 


  \item \textbf{Likelihood function} \L of a model, given some data:
%\beq 
\begin{equation}
\L(\mu|x) = P(x|\mu) ,
\end{equation}
%\eeq
The \emph{likelihood} of a model expectation $\mu$, given the
data point $x$, is equal to the \emph{probability} of the data point
$x$, given the expectation value~$\mu$. 
%Important: In general, $\int \L
%\neq 1$, \L is \emph{not} a PDF.

  \frametitle{Profile likelihood analyses}

\bit 
  \item Simple (1D) case: Assuming 

\beq
\L \left(\vec{\pi}=(p, \vec{n})|\vec{d} \right)
\eeq

with the parameter of interest $p$ and nuisance parameters $\vec{n}$, \\
the \emph{profile likelihood} is defined as:

\beq
\mathcal{PL}(p_0|\vec{d}) = \frac{\max(\L(p=p_0, \vec{n}))}{\max(\L(p,
  \vec{n}))}, 
\eeq

where the maximization is performed over the \emph{complete} parameter
range ($\forall \pi$)
for the denominator, but only for the subrange with $p=p_0$ for the
numerator. \\ (\ra ``likelihood ratio test statistic'') 

  \item Wilks \& Co.: $-2\ln (\mathcal{PL})$ approaches $\chi^2(1)$ \\
    \ra possibility to infer parameter ranges / limits.

  \frametitle{\L for ACT observations}

Two Poisson processes:
\bit 
  \item signal
  \item background 
\eit 

 ~ 

Construct Likelihood as: 
\beq
\L(s,b|\non, \noff) = P(\non|s+\alpha b)\times P(\noff|b)
\eeq
Simplifying step: Assume $b=\noff$.

 ~ 

\emph{Dark matter} signal expectation: 

\beq
s  = \frac{\sigmav}{8\pi m_\chi^2} \times T_{\sf obs} \times \jbar
\times \int dE\; A_{\sf eff}(E) \frac{dN}{dE}(E)
\eeq

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Combined likelihood / stacking analysis}

Combined likelihood of several data sets:

\beq
\mathcal{CL} = \prod_i \L_i\left(s, ...\right)
\eeq

 ~ 

Next: Include uncertainty of \jbar for each data set:

\beq
\L_i \ra \L_i \left(\sigmav, m_\chi, \jbar_i | \non, \noff \right) 
\times PDF(\jbar_i),
\eeq 

assuming a log-normal distribution of true \jbar around the values
determined by the people who do these things (Walker et al 2011,
Charbonnier et al. 2011).

\beq 
PDF(\jbar) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\ln(10)\jbar_i\sigma_{\jbar, i}} 
\exp \left\{-0.5\frac{[\log(\jbar_i) - \log(\jbar_{{\sf mean},i})]^2
  }{\sigma_{\jbar, i}^2} \right\}

  \frametitle{Combined likelihood}

Hence, the full combined likelihood $\mathcal{CL}$ is a function of:
\bit
  \item  $\sigmav$, $m_\chi$ and the (``true'') \jbar factors of all
    targets \\ (these are the ``free'' parameters!)
  \item the experimental parameters of each observation ($T_{\sf obs}, A_{\sf eff}$) 
  \item the experimental results (\non, \noff)
\eit 

 ~ 

Next step: 

Calculate combined profile likelihood $\mathcal{PL}$,
as a function of fixed $\sigmav_f$, for fixed DM masses $m_f$ \ra
maximize $\mathcal{CL}$ over the $\jbar$'s:

\beq
-2 \ln \mathcal{PL}(\sigmav_f, m_f) = -2 \ln \left( \frac{\max\left[\mathcal{CL}(\sigmav_f,
    m_f, \{\jbar\})\right]}{\max \left[\mathcal{CL}(\sigmav, m_f, \{\jbar\})\right]} \right)
